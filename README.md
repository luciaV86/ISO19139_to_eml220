# ISO19139_to_eml220
This XSLT transformation has been developed in the scope of the Soil Water Content Use Case within the ENVRI-FAIR project (https://envri.eu/home-envri-fair/).
It allows to convert ISO19139 dataset metadata records into EML2.2.0 dataset metadata records.
The destination metadata schema does not include all the metadata fields but only the fields agreed with the Research Infrastructures (RIs) involved in the use case.
The transformation allows to automatically harvest dataset metadata records coming from the different RIs and to store them on the LifeWatch ERIC Metadata Catalogue (https://metadatacatalogue.lifewatch.eu).
